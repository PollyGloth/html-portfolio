<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Alex, I'm 32 years old and currently in Japan on a working holiday visa, because I love Japan.</p>

<p>Seriously: I love Japan. I'm learning how to code now, so that I can find a proper job.</p>

<p>Please give me a job, so that I can stay in Japan.</p>
<p>Also: employers love me - you won't regret hiring me!</p>
