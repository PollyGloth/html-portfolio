<h3>What not to bring:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Baloons (I'm afraid of baloons because I once almost ruined one of my eyes with it)</li>
  <li>Cava and/or Aperol (Yes, I'm a woman but no, please don't)</li>
  <li>Plants as gifts (Unable to take care of them)</li>
</ul>

<h3>This is not where I live, but have a look at this fun picture on Google Maps:</h3>
